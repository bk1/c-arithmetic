# c-arithmetic
Some functions for very basic arithmetic operations, like recovery of carry bit, that use the CPU integer arithmetic to the extent possible from C without using assembly language

This library is used for some experiments with low level arithmetic using C.

It is not intended for production use, because there are good and mature libraries that are doing arithmetic very well, like the gmp-library and the built in libraries of many programming languages.

If this project would achieve useful implementations that could improve the performance of one of these builtin libraries, then the goal would be to submit these improvements to the existing libraries.
